<h3>Command line usage</h3>
<p>
	If you prefer command line and trust the basic automatic detection
	algorithm use it this way (can be batched!):<br />
<pre>
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s [SOURCEFILE] [-d [DESTINATIONFILE]]
</pre>
Example:
<pre>
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s dogeatdog.pdf -d dogcrop.pdf
java -jar briss-0.0.13.jar -s dogeatdog.pdf 
</pre>
<p>the second line will crop the file into
<pre>dogeatdog_cropped.pdf</pre>
